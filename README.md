The data is located within the data folder: 2 CSV files named Mouse_metadata and Study_results

Analysis
There is a positive correlation between the weight of the mice and the tumor size. The P-value of 0.84 indicates this linear correlation. Therefore, we might want to keep the mice doing exercise to help them decrease tumor size.
Capomulin seems to be an effective drug regimen to treat the cancer. The tumor size in mouse b128 decreased as time went on. Of the 4 drug regimens we analyzed, Capomulin and Ramicane were the most effective at decreasing tumor size. The least effective were the other two drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin.
